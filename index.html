                <p class="sdv-info inline center">Barone began working on Stardew Valley in 2012 and released it in 2016. He was praised for creating the game independently,
                    as its sole designer, programmer, animator, artist, composer, and writer. To complete the game, Barone worked 10 hours a day,
                    seven days a week, for four and a half years; living in Capitol Hill, Seattle. For part of that time, he lived with his parents
                    to save money after which he and his then girlfriend moved in together.
                    <br>
                    Barone initially released Stardew on the PC before later developing it for other consoles. By March 2022, he had sold over 20
                    million copies.
                    <br>
                    In 2017, he was named by Forbes magazine in their list "30 Under 30: Games" due to his work on Stardew Valley. Since 2019,
                    Barone has been assisted on Stardew Valley by another designer.</p>
